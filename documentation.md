#### Introduction
This application was created to represent a solution to the problem defined in the report that was delivered in November 2020 on the subject of Contemporary Web Applications taught in Solent University under the course Computing Year 4. The problem I defined in the said report was that students often have a hard time managing their time wether because they are working full/part time or any other reason. My potential solution was a simple to-do task application that is easy enough to work with while not sacrificing any features and is considerably well themed with plans to be made so that the user can choose their own theme, pictures etc. so they could feel more invested in the app by adding their personal touch.

#### Methodology
The main methodology I used was The James Martin Rapid Application Development (RAD) method. It is divided in four phases:

1) Requirements and planning phase
2) User design phase
3) Construction phase
4) Cutover phase

The first two phases were reflected in my report where I defined the problem, gathered data from fellow students and used it to develop a design. The other two phases are the construction and cutover phase that I am going to go through now. 
The construction phase is focused on the programming and the development of the app itself. Usually the user/client is present and participates in the development process. As I was extremely time constrained I had to limit the user testing to an informal closed group of fellow students that were testing the views/screens as I developed them in order to give me either styling or layout feedback.
